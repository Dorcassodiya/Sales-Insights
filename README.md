# Sales-Insights

This is a project I worked on under MERI SKILLS internship
Here  are some of the insights I was able to draw from the sales analytics dashboards:

**Overall Sales:**

Total revenue for the period is $34.49 million.
Total quantity ordered for the period is 209,080 units.
Profit margin for the period is 0.588.
The weekly distribution of sales is almost evenly spread.
There were more orders for AAA-Batteries(4-pack) and AA-Batteries(4-pack) than other products.

**Top 5 Revenue-Generating Cities:**

The top 5 revenue-generating cities are San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston and Atlanta .
These cities account for over 50% of total revenue.

**City-level Insights:**

In **San Francisco**, total revenue generated was 8.26 million. From the dashboard, we notice that the most sales are made between 6pm and 8pm and alos at noon. The products which generates the highest revenue in San Francisco are Macbook Pro Laptop, Iphone and ThinkPad Laptop.
A similar trend is noticed in **Los Angeles** as regards the hour of the day with the most sales.
In **Boston**, there was no sales in January and barely any in Febuary too. The highest sales was also recorded between 6pm and 9pm, and between 11am and 1pm.

**Insights and Recommendations:**

Overall sales are trending upwards. This is a positive trend and suggests that the company's sales efforts are working.
The company should focus on the top 5 revenue-generating cities to maximize revenue. These cities account for over 50% of total revenue, so even a small increase in sales in these cities could have a significant impact on overall revenue.
